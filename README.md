Books At Your Doorstep is a full-stack scalable web application that aims to enable users to add book details with the number of copies to the portal and allow users to borrow books from the portal. 

Features:
* There are two types of users to this system - lenders and borrowers. Created a login/sign-up system to let the users register themselves to access the portal.
* The Lender's dashboard contains 'Add Books' view, where he can add the details of books he wants to upload, 'My Books' view displays his added books or wants to update/delete the book details, 'My Book Orders' - where he can see the status of his uploaded books such as the borrowers of his books. 
* Borrower's dashboard contains a 'Books Gallery' view where he can browse through all the books added by different lenders on the portal. Each book has a book details view. He can select different books and add them to his orders. The 'Orders' view enables the user to borrow or return or check the status of his books, such as the due date of the borrowed books. 
* Each time a user borrows/returns a book, both the borrower and the lender are sent a confirmation mail.
